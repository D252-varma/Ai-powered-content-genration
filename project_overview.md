### 4. Project Description

#### 4.1 Overview
The Keyword Extraction System is a machine learning-based solution that automatically identifies and extracts relevant keywords from text content. It uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in keyword extraction.

#### 4.2 Key Components

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Removes special characters and digits
   - Tokenizes text into words
   - Removes stopwords
   - Performs lemmatization

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
   - Considers unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams
   - Maximum 10,000 features
   - Removes common and rare terms

3. **Classification Model**
   - OneVsRest Classifier with Logistic Regression
   - Handles multi-label classification
   - Uses balanced class weights
   - Threshold-based keyword selection

4. **Keyword Processing**
   - MultiLabelBinarizer for label encoding
   - Probability threshold of 0.2
   - Handles 243 different keyword classes

#### 4.3 Implementation Details

```python
# Model Pipeline
model = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(
        analyzer='word',
        ngram_range=(1, 3),
        max_features=10000,
        min_df=2,
        max_df=0.95,
        stop_words='english'
    )),
    ('clf', OneVsRestClassifier(
        LogisticRegression(
            class_weight='balanced',
            max_iter=1000,
            solver='liblinear'
        )
    ))
])
```
